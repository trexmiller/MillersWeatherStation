# MillersWeatherStation




<h2>Millers Weather Station PCB

<h6>This is the main PCB for our personal weather station we constructed. It reads Davis anemometers, a BME680 and some light sensors. Data is sent to PWS and other online sites using the WINC1500 WiFi module. Data messages are also sent out the bluetooth modem.
